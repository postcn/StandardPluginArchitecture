To Run, make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.
This program has been tested and run on Java 1.8. It may not be backwards compatible with previous versions of Java.

Execute the PluginPlatform.jar executable jar file. This will launch the platform.
Once the platform is launched, it will create the folder that you need to place the plugin jars in. ./Plugins

To add plugins, drop them into the folder at any point. The three plugins we have available are:
BallWorld.jar - A plugin which makes a random number of randomly sized and colored balls bounce around the render panel.
Calculator.jar - A plugin which functions as a simple calculator.
Game.jar - A plugin which accepts key input from the arrows and lets your green circle run away from the red circles.

Launching plugins is done by clicking on their respective name in the listing panel.
Each plugin may have vastly different behavior once is is loaded.
Messages appear in the message pane.
